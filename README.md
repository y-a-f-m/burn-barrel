# burn-barrels
Factorio mod: Use oil barrels as fuel. The entire thing.

## Features

- Just yeet those barrels straight into the fire it's fine we're doing this Haliburton style
- Damaged barrels come out, but you can melt them down into more iron plates (if you're Captain Planet)
- Changes solid fuel into asphalt blocks - you can still burn it, but it'll pollute to high heaven and isn't that efficient to boot
- Barrel fuel values should scale with mods that alter barrel capacity
- You can burn lubricant too, I mean why not

## Anti-features

- More resources to manage
- More iron consumption
- You actually have to use barrels
- Barrel-y tested

## Unimplemented features

- Inserters that can yeet the barrel over your walls where it then explodes in a fireball
- Better handling of things that use "chemical" type fuel but aren't cars, locomotives, furnaces, or boilers
- Automatic support for modded fluids with fuel_value
- Configuration UI to disable the solid fuel nerf
- Automatic generation of recycling recipe for mods that change the barrel recipe
- Better graphics

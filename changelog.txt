Version: 0.5.0
Date: 2022-02-23
  Features:
    - Just yeet those barrels straight into the fire it's fine we're doing this Haliburton style
    - Damaged barrels come out, but you can melt them down into more iron plates (if you're Captain Planet)
    - Changes solid fuel into asphalt blocks - you can still burn it, but it'll pollute to high heaven and isn't that efficient to boot
    - Barrel fuel values should scale with mods that alter barrel capacity
    - You can burn lubricant too, I mean why not
